## About

**Vale** is a free, open-source linter for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind.

Unlike most writing aids, Vale's primary purpose isn't to provide its own advice; it's designed to
enforce an existing style guide through its YAML-based [extension system](/vale/styles).

No matter if you're working with a small in-house standard or a large editorial style guide, Vale
will help you maintain consistent and error-free writing.

## Installation

Vale runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be installed via one of the package managers listed
below or manually by downloading an executable from the
[releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases).

## Quickstart

After installing Vale via one of the options listed above, you'll need to create a
[configuration](/vale/config) file:

```ini
# This goes in a file named either `.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`.
#
# Alerts are assigned a level of suggestion, warning, or error.
MinAlertLevel = warning

# We only want to lint Markdown files.
[*.md]
# Vale comes with three built-in styles: write-good, proselint, and Joblint.
#
# Here, we specify that we want to enable all rules in the "write-good" style.
BasedOnStyles = write-good
```

In this example, we're using Vale's built-in style for
[`write-good`](https://github.com/btford/write-good), but you can also create your
[own styles](/vale/styles).

Next, to verify that the installation was successful, we'll use the following
example Markdown file:

```md
## Getting Started

Rule 1: Don't start sentences with "so":

> So, this is an example sentence.

Rule 2: Don't start a sentence with "there is" or "there are":

> There are many ways to start a sentence.
```

Finally, let's run Vale and check its output:

```bash
# Our working directory contains our config file and the test Markdown file.
$ ls -a
.         ..        .vale.ini test.md
$ vale test.md

 test.md
 5:1   error    Do not start a sentence with     write-good.So
                'So,'
 9:1   error    Do not start a sentence with     write-good.ThereIs
                'There are'
 9:11  warning  'many' is a weasel word!         write-good.Weasel

âœ– 2 errors, 1 warning and 0 suggestions in 1 file.
```

See [Usage](/vale/usage) for more information about using the command-line
interface.
