Vale Server is designed to compliment (not replace) Vale:
all styles, plugins, and configuration files are compatible[^1] with the
original Vale command-line tool.

To use your Vale styles, simply copy them onto Vale Server's `StylesPath` (
<img src="/vale-server/img/menu-icon.png" style="height: 18px; padding-left: 2px; padding-right: 2px">
<i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> **Browse Styles...**) and assign them to a Project.

[^1]: The only exception is Projects, which is a feature exclusive
to Vale Server.
