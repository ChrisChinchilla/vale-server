Vale Server is a cross-platform (Windows and macOS) desktop application that
enforces writing style guides. It's built on top of, and offers a high degree
of compatibility with, the [Vale command-line tool](/cli).

## *Your* style, *our* editor

Vale Server isn't another automated grammar checker. It doesn't attempt to
teach you how to write; it's a tool *for* writers.

More specifically, Vale Server focuses (primarily) on writing style rather than
grammatical correctness. It works by enforcing rules  that are defined in YAML
files:

```yml title="Headings.yml"
message: "'%s' should use sentence-style capitalization."
level: suggestion
scope: heading
match: $sentence
exceptions:
  - Azure
  - CLI
```

Multiple rules are packaged together to form styles that you can choose to
follow. The open-source library of styles currently includes implementations
for:

- [The Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/)
- [The Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
- [`proselint`](https://github.com/amperser/proselint/blob/master/README.md)
- [`write-good`](https://github.com/btford/write-good/blob/master/README.md)
- [`Joblint`](https://github.com/rowanmanning/joblint/blob/master/README.md)

Of course, you can also create your own using the [extension system](styles).

## Syntax-aware and web-ready

Vale Server understands its input at both a syntactic and contextual level.
It's built on top of state-of-the-art NLP (natural language processing)
technology that makes it possible for rules to target specific sections of
text&mdash;such as headings, paragraphs, and sentences.

In addition to its understanding of writing structure, [Vale Server also has
special support](concepts/scoping) for XML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, and HTML. This
support is powered by a scoping system (shown above) that allows Vale Server to
intelligently handle markup syntax, including the ability to ignore code, URLs,
and other non-prose sections entirely.

## Private and secure

Vale Server's architecture is different from most writing applications and
services: since it has an open-source core, the server-side logic is bundled
*with* the application and runs on `localhost`&mdash;meaning your content never
has to leave your own computer.
