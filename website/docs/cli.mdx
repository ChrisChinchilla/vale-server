[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gojp/goreportcard?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/errata-ai/vale) ![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/errata-ai/vale/total?logo=GitHub&style=flat-square) ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jdkato/vale?color=lgreen&logo=docker&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)

Vale Server is built on top of [Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale), a
command-line tool that brings code-like linting to prose. Every release
of Vale Server ships with Vale and uses it to power most of its linting
features.

Vale can also be installed and used as a completely standalone tool, which is
the use case that this page will focus on covering.

Vale is cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux), written in
[Go](https://golang.org/), and
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale). Some of Vale's key
features are:

- [Usability](/concepts/scoping): Vale capable of understanding *real* content&mdash;it supports
  HTML, Markdown (CommonMark), AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, XML, and DITA. It doesn't require
  preprocessing or other hacky workarounds to avoid syntax-related false positives.

- [Extensibility](/concepts/styles): Vale's primary purpose, unlike most writing-related software,
  isn't to provide its own advice; it's designed to enforce an existing style guide through its
  YAML-based extension system.

- [Portability](/concepts/configuration): Vale is both highly configurable and portable: its
  plain-text configuration system allows the same settings to be used anywhere: an editor,
  terminal, CI service, etc.

## Installation

:::info Heads up!
If you're using Vale with a markup format other than Markdown or HTML, you'll also need to [install
a parser](/concepts/scoping).
:::

You have a few options to choose from for installing Vale:

- Download an executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases);

- pull the [latest Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdkato/vale); or

- use one of the supported [package managers](https://repology.org/project/vale/versions):

## Tutorial

The [`vale-boilerplate`](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-boilerplate)
repository provides a starting point for getting Vale set up. If you clone or
download this repository and run Vale from its root, you'll see the following
results:

```shell
$ vale .

 README.md
 13:20   warning  'extremely' is a weasel word!  write-good.Weasel
 15:120  warning  'However' is too wordy.        write-good.TooWordy
 27:6    warning  'is' is repeated!              write-good.Illusions

✖ 0 errors, 3 warnings and 0 suggestions in 2 files.
```

The basic directory stucture that you'll need to include in your own projects
is as follows:

```text
.
├── .vale.ini
├── README.md
└── styles
    └── write-good
```

The first file you'll need to create is called `.vale.ini`:

```ini title=".vale.ini"
StylesPath = styles

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = write-good
```

This the central point of configuration for Vale&mdash;it specifies *what* and
*how* to lint, as well as where to look for other Vale-related files. Vale will
start looking for this file in the same directory as the file that's being
linted. If it can't find one, it'll search up to 6 levels up the directory
tree (see [`--config`](cli#--config) to override this behavior). After 6
levels, it'll look for a global configuration file in the OS equivalent of
`$HOME` (see the table below).

If more than one configuration file is present, the closest one to the active
file takes precedence. See the dedicated [Configuration](/concepts/config)
section for more information.

| OS | Search Locations |
| :--- | :--- |
| Windows | `$HOME`, `%UserProfile%`, or `%HomeDrive%%HomePath%` |
| macOS | `$HOME` |
| Linux | `$HOME` |

The next step is to create your
[`StylesPath`](/concepts/styles) (`/styles` above), which serves as the on-disk
location for all Vale-related files.

The final step is to provide content to lint (`README.md` above). Vale works on
both single files and entire directories, and supports
[multiple file types](/concepts/scoping).

## Reference

At its core, Vale is designed to be used as a command-line tool. The available commands and options
are discussed below.

### `ls-config`

Print the current configuration options \(as JSON\) to `stdout`.

```bash
$ vale ls-config
{
  "BlockIgnores": {},
  "Checks": null,
  "Formats": {},
  "GBaseStyles": null,
  "GChecks": {},
  "IgnoredClasses": null,
  "IgnoredScopes": null,
  "MinAlertLevel": 0,
  "Path": "...",
  "Project": "",
  "RuleToLevel": {},
  "SBaseStyles": {
    "*.md": [
      "Vale"
    ]
  },
  "SChecks": {
    "*.md": {}
  },
  "SkippedScopes": null,
  "Stylesheets": {},
  "StylesPath": "...",
  "TokenIgnores": {},
  "WordTemplate": "",
  "SphinxBuild": "",
  "SphinxAuto": ""
}
```

(See [Configuration](/concepts/config) for more information about the available options.)

### `new-rule`

Generate a template for the given extension point.

```bash
$ vale new-rule existence
extends: existence
message: Consider removing '%s'
level: warning
code: false
ignorecase: true
tokens:
    - appears to be
    - arguably
```

Where `existence` could be any of the available extension points.

### `tag` (<span className="badge badge--secondary">v2.3.0</span>)

Assign part-of-speech tags to the given sentence.

```bash
$ vale tag "Lebron James plays basketball in Los Angeles."
lebron/NNP james/NNP plays/VBZ basketball/NN in/IN los/NNP angeles/NNP
```

### `--help`

The `--help` option prints Vale's CLI usage information to `stdout`.

```bash
$ vale -h
...
```

### `--glob`

The `--glob` option specifies the type of files Vale will search. It accepts
the [standard GNU/Linux syntax](https://github.com/gobwas/glob). Additionally,
any pattern prefixed with an `!` will be negated. For example,

```bash
# Exclude `.txt` files
$ vale --glob='!*.txt' directory
...
# Only search `.md` and `.rst` files
$ vale --glob='*.{md,rst}' directory
...
```

This option takes precedence over any patterns defined in your
[configuration file](/concepts/config).

### `--config`

The `--config` option specifies the location of a configuration file. This
will take precedence over the [default search process]().

```bash
$ vale --config='some/file/path/.vale.ini'
```

### `--output`

The `--output` option specifies the format that Vale will use to report its
alerts.

```bash
# "line", "JSON", or "CLI" (the default)
$ vale --output=JSON directory
```

### `--ext`

The `--ext` option allows you to assign a format \(e.g., `.md`\) to text passed
via `stdin` \(which will default to `.txt`\).

```bash
$ vale --ext='.md' '# this is a heading'
```

### `--no-wrap`

The `--no-wrap` option disables word wrapping when using the `CLI` output
format. By default, `CLI` output will be wrapped to fit your console.

```bash
$ vale --no-wrap directory
```

### `--no-exit`

The `--no-exit` option instructs Vale to always return an exit code of `0`,
even if errors were found. This is useful if you don't want CI builds to fail
on Vale-related errors.

```text
$ vale --no-exit directory
```

### `--sort`

The `--sort` option instructs Vale to sort its output by file path. For large
directories, this can have a noticeable impact on performance.

```bash
$ vale --sort directory
```

### `--ignore-syntax`

The `--ignore-syntax` option will cause Vale to _parse_ all files as plain
text. Note, though, that this doesn't change what files Vale will _search_.

This will often boost performance significantly, but only `text`-scoped rules
will work.

```text
$ vale --ignore-syntax directory
```

### `--version`

The `--version` option prints Vale's version.

```text
$ vale --version
...
```

### `--debug`

The `--debug` option instructs Vale to print debugging information to `stdout`.

```text
$ vale --debug test.md
...
```

### `--minAlertLevel`

The `--minAlertLevel` option sets the minimum alert level to display. This
takes precedence over the value set in a configuration file.

```bash
$ vale --minAlertLevel LEVEL
```

Where `LEVEL` is `suggestion`, `warning`, or `error`.
