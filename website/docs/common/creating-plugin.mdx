# Creating a plugin that uses Vale


Vale can provide JSON output that extensions can use, how you get this output can depend on if you use Vale server or CLI.



```shell
vale --output JSON {path/file}
```

_http://localhost:7777/file_ with a `file` and `path` query


```json
{
  "index.md": [
    {
      "Action": {
        "Name": "",
        "Params": null
      },
      "Check": "write-good.Passive",
      "Description": "",
      "Line": 6,
      "Link": "",
      "Message": "'was created' may be passive voice. Use active voice if you can.",
      "Severity": "warning",
      "Span": [
        59,
        69
      ],
      "Match": "was created"
    },
    â€¦
  ]
}
```

The top of the JSON is the file name, then an array of check objects that contain the following information.

- `Action`: An action or change to the text that Vale server can take with a rule, containing a `Name` for the action, and `Params` passed to the action.
- `Check`: The rule set and rule triggered.
- `Description`:
- `Line`: The line that contains the error.
- `Link`: Link to explanation of style guide rule
- `Message`: Help text output by the rule
- `Severity`: The error level.
- `Span`: The start and finish characters on the line.
- `Match`: The text matched.
