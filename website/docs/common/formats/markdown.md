[GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) support is built in.
By default, indented blocks, fenced blocks, and code spans are ignored.

If you're using another flavor of Markdown, see
[non-standard markup](#non-standard-markup) for information on how to
make your flavor compatible.
