[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/gojp/goreportcard?style=flat-square&logo=go&logoColor=white)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/errata-ai/vale) ![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/errata-ai/vale/total?logo=GitHub&style=flat-square) ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jdkato/vale?color=lgreen&logo=docker&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)

**Vale** is a cross-platform \(macOS, Windows, and Linux\), command-line [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) for prose built with speed and extensibility in mind. Its key features are as follows:

* [Markup support](getting-started/markup.md): Vale supports HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, XML, and DITA—allowing it to avoid most syntax-related false positives.
* [Extensibility](getting-started/styles.md): Unlike most writing-related software, Vale's primary purpose isn't to provide its own advice; it's designed to enforce an existing style guide through its YAML-based extension system.
* [Performance](https://gist.github.com/jdkato/02bb9db72cf6d36c7a52d8b075bdb5df#file-perf-md): Vale typically takes less than 1 second to lint most files, making it fast enough to be included in test suites for large \(&gt; 1,000 files\) repositories.

No matter if you're working with a small in-house standard or a large editorial style guide, Vale will help you maintain consistent and error-free writing.

## Installation

:::info Heads up!
If you're using Vale with a markup format other than **Markdown** or **HTML**, you'll also need to install a [parser](getting-started/markup.md#formats).
