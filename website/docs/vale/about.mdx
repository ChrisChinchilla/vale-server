**Vale** is a cross-platform \(macOS, Windows, and Linux\), command-line
[linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) for prose built with speed and
extensibility in mind. Its key features include:

* [Usability](/vale/scoping): Vale supports HTML, Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, XML, and
  DITA&mdash;allowing it to "just work" on *real-world* content.

* [Extensibility](/vale/styles): Unlike most writing-related software, Vale's primary purpose isn't
  to provide its own advice; it's designed to enforce an existing style guide through its
  YAML-based extension system.

* [Portability](/vale/config): Vale uses a plain-text configuration system that makes it
  possible to share configurations across platforms, applications, and users.

No matter if you're working with a small in-house standard or a large editorial style guide, Vale
will help you maintain consistent and error-free writing.

## Funding &amp; sponsorships

If you'd like to support the continued development and support of Vale, you may contribute
financially by doing any of the following:

- Purchasing a license (Individual or Enterprise) for [Vale Server](https://errata.ai/vale-server/),
  a cross-platform desktop application for Vale that introduces a number of style-management
  features and integration options.

- Making a recurring pledge or a one-time donation through the
  [Open Source Collective [501(c)(6)]](https://opencollective.com/vale).

Both of these options allow me ([@jdkato](https://github.com/jdkato)) to dedicate more time to
*maintaining* (e.g., bug fixes, feature requests, support questions, and documentation
improvements) Vale and its collection of open-source and permissively-licensed
[styles](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles), integrations, and extensions.
