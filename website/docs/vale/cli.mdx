In order to familiarize ourselves with the typical Vale workflow, we'll be
referencing a [sample repository](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-boilerplate)
that contains the required components of a Vale configuration.

:::info Heads up!
If you're on Windows, we recommend using [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
instead of the default Command Prompt (which doesn't support all of Vale's features,
as shown below):

<Tabs
  defaultValue="tty"
  values={[
    { label: 'Windows Terminal', value: 'tty', },
    { label: 'Command Prompt', value: 'cmd', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="tty">

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cmd">

If you'd like to follow along locally, download or clone sample repository and
copy the terminal session below:

```bash
$ cd vale-boilerplate
# Check your version of Vale:
$ vale -h
# Run Vale on the sample content:
$ vale README.md

 README.md
 13:20   warning  'extremely' is a weasel word!  write-good.Weasel
 15:120  warning  'However' is too wordy.        write-good.TooWordy
 27:6    warning  'is' is repeated!              write-good.Illusions

✖ 0 errors, 3 warnings and 0 suggestions in 1 file.
```

## `StylesPath`

The first component we're going to discuss is our `StylesPath` (the `/styles`
directory):

```console
$ tree styles
├───Microsoft
├───Vocab
│   ├───Blog
│   └───Marketing
└───write-good
```

This where you'll store all of your Vale-related files (with the exception of
`.vale.ini`, discussed below).

### Styles

In the example above, the `Microsoft` and `write-good` top-level directories
are both [*styles*](/vale/styles). These are collections of individual writing
rules packaged together to enforce guidelines from a third-party organization
or tool.

In practice, you'll typically come across two types of styles:

- `prose -> YAML`: These styles take *written* guidelines (such as those
  from the
  [*Microsoft Writing Style Guide*](https://github.com/errata-ai/Microsoft))
  and convert them into a collection of Vale-compatiable YAML files. The
  benefits of this process are that the style becomes both machine-readable and
  machine-enforceable.

- `code -> YAML`: These styles take guidelines enforced by a
  language-dependent tool (such as JavaScript's
  [`write-good`](https://github.com/errata-ai/write-good)) and convert them
  into a collection of Vale-compatiable YAML files. The benefits of this
  process often include [improved support for markup](/vale/scoping) and easier
  installation and usage (Vale is a standalone, cross-platform
  binary&mdash;meaning you don't have to worry about configuring a programming
  language and its dependencies).

The dedicated [styles](/vale/styles) section explains how you can create your
own custom style. You can also browse our [collection of pre-made, open-source
styles](https://github.com/errata-ai/styles).

### Vocab

The [`Vocab` directory](/vale/vocab) is a special directory design to
supplement your styles. Each of its child directories&mdash;in this case,
`Blog` and `Marketing`&mdash;contain two files: `accept.txt` and `reject.txt`.

These files allow you to control rule "exceptions" (such as what is considered
a spelling error) without having to modify the style's source itself.

## `.vale.ini`

The `.vale.ini` file is where you'll control the majority of Vale's behavior,
including what files to lint and how to lint them:

```ini title=".vale.ini"
# Example Vale config file (`.vale.ini` or `_vale.ini`)

StylesPath = styles

Vocab = Blog

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = write-good
```

See the dedicated [configuration](/vale/config) section for more information.

## `README.md`

In the sample repository, `README.md` represents the content we want to lint.
And while you probably have a lot more content than a single Markdown file,
this example demonstrates one of Vale's most useful features: its support for
different [markup languages](/vale/scoping).

In practice, this means that you can use Vale on "real-world" markup (that
contains front matter, source code, tables, lists, etc.) and Vale will be able
to both intelligently *apply rules to* and *completely ignore* certain sections
of text.



## CLI Reference

At its core, Vale is designed to be used as a command-line tool. The available
commands and options are discussed below.

### `ls-config`

Print the current configuration options \(as JSON\) to `stdout`.

```bash
$ vale ls-config
{
  "BlockIgnores": {},
  "Checks": null,
  "Formats": {},
  "GBaseStyles": null,
  "GChecks": {},
  "IgnoredClasses": null,
  "IgnoredScopes": null,
  "MinAlertLevel": 0,
  "Path": "...",
  "Project": "",
  "RuleToLevel": {},
  "SBaseStyles": {
    "*.md": [
      "Vale"
    ]
  },
  "SChecks": {
    "*.md": {}
  },
  "SkippedScopes": null,
  "Stylesheets": {},
  "StylesPath": "...",
  "TokenIgnores": {},
  "WordTemplate": "",
  "SphinxBuild": "",
  "SphinxAuto": ""
}
```

(See [Configuration](/concepts/config) for more information about the available options.)

### `new-rule`

Generate a template for the given extension point.

```bash
$ vale new-rule existence
extends: existence
message: Consider removing '%s'
level: warning
code: false
ignorecase: true
tokens:
    - appears to be
    - arguably
```

Where `existence` could be any of the available extension points.

### `tag` (<span className="badge badge--secondary">v2.3.0</span>)

Assign part-of-speech tags to the given sentence.

```bash
$ vale tag "Lebron James plays basketball in Los Angeles."
lebron/NNP james/NNP plays/VBZ basketball/NN in/IN los/NNP angeles/NNP
```

### `--help`

The `--help` option prints Vale's CLI usage information to `stdout`.

```bash
$ vale -h
...
```

### `--glob`

The `--glob` option specifies the type of files Vale will search. It accepts
the [standard GNU/Linux syntax](https://github.com/gobwas/glob). Additionally,
any pattern prefixed with an `!` will be negated. For example,

```bash
# Exclude `.txt` files
$ vale --glob='!*.txt' directory
...
# Only search `.md` and `.rst` files
$ vale --glob='*.{md,rst}' directory
...
```

This option takes precedence over any patterns defined in your
[configuration file](/concepts/config).

### `--config`

The `--config` option specifies the location of a configuration file. This
will take precedence over the [default search process]().

```bash
$ vale --config='some/file/path/.vale.ini'
```

### `--output`

The `--output` option specifies the format that Vale will use to report its
alerts.

```bash
# "line", "JSON", or "CLI" (the default)
$ vale --output=JSON directory
```

### `--ext`

The `--ext` option allows you to assign a format \(e.g., `.md`\) to text passed
via `stdin` \(which will default to `.txt`\).

```bash
$ vale --ext='.md' '# this is a heading'
```

### `--no-wrap`

The `--no-wrap` option disables word wrapping when using the `CLI` output
format. By default, `CLI` output will be wrapped to fit your console.

```bash
$ vale --no-wrap directory
```

### `--no-exit`

The `--no-exit` option instructs Vale to always return an exit code of `0`,
even if errors were found. This is useful if you don't want CI builds to fail
on Vale-related errors.

```text
$ vale --no-exit directory
```

### `--sort`

The `--sort` option instructs Vale to sort its output by file path. For large
directories, this can have a noticeable impact on performance.

```bash
$ vale --sort directory
```

### `--ignore-syntax`

The `--ignore-syntax` option will cause Vale to _parse_ all files as plain
text. Note, though, that this doesn't change what files Vale will _search_.

This will often boost performance significantly, but only `text`-scoped rules
will work.

```text
$ vale --ignore-syntax directory
```

### `--version`

The `--version` option prints Vale's version.

```text
$ vale --version
...
```

### `--debug`

The `--debug` option instructs Vale to print debugging information to `stdout`.

```text
$ vale --debug test.md
...
```

### `--minAlertLevel`

The `--minAlertLevel` option sets the minimum alert level to display. This
takes precedence over the value set in a configuration file.

```bash
$ vale --minAlertLevel LEVEL
```

Where `LEVEL` is `suggestion`, `warning`, or `error`.
