Vale offers multiple options for installation, each of which best suits a particular use case. The
quickest way to get started, though, is by using either
[Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/vale#default) (macOS and Linux) or
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/vale) (Windows):

:::info Heads up!
If you're using Vale with a markup format other than **Markdown** or **HTML**, you'll also need to
install a [parser](/vale/scoping#formats).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="mac"
  values={[
    { label: 'macOS', value: 'mac', },
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'win', },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="mac">

```shell
$ brew install vale
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="win">

```bash
> choco install vale
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
$ brew install vale
```
Or use another [package manager](https://repology.org/project/vale/versions).
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Remote, collaborative use

One of Vale's strengths is its ability to help a company, project, or organization maintain consistency \(capitalization styles, word choice, brand terminology, spelling, etc.\) across multiple writers.

The benefits of these installation methods are that every writer has access to the same Vale configuration without having to install and configure the tool themselves.

### Using Vale with GitHub

If you want to lint the contents of a GitHub repository, the recommended approach is to use Vale's [official GitHub Action](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action).

### Using Vale with a continuous integration \(CI\) service

If you want to use Vale with a CI service such as Travis CI, CircleCI, or Jenkins, the recommended approach is to use Vale's [`GoDownloader`](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader) script \(Vale will be installed to `/bin/vale`\):

```bash
$ curl -sfL https://install.goreleaser.com/github.com/ValeLint/vale.sh | sh -s vX.Y.Z
$ export PATH="./bin:$PATH"
$ vale -v
```

where `vX.Y.Z` is your version of choice from the [releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases). This will ensure that your CI builds are consistent and allow you to update versions on an opt-in basis.

## Local use by a single writer

Vale can also be used locally by a single writer through the command line or a third-party integration.

### Using Vale with a text editor \(or another third-party application\)

Vale has a commercial desktop application, [Vale Server](https://errata.ai/vale-server/), that integrates with [many third-party applications](https://errata-ai.github.io/vale-server/docs/usage#step-5-using-a-client-application) \(including Atom, Sublime Text, VS Code, and Google Docs\) and allows writers to easily create and switch between multiple local Vale configurations.

### Using Vale from the command line

Vale can be installed for local usage. To install the CLI, use one of the following options:

* Download an executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale/releases).
* Pull the [latest Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jdkato/vale).
* Use one of the available [package managers](https://repology.org/project/vale/versions):
