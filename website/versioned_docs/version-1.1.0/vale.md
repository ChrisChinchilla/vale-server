Vale Server is designed to complement Vale (the command-line tool): Vale excels in CI/automated environments, while Vale Server works well locally.

For more information on using Vale and Vale Server together, see [The Vale Workflow](https://medium.com/@jdkato/the-vale-workflow-3b709fa39212) blog post.
